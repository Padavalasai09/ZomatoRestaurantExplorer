# Project Assignment: Zomato Restaurant Listing & Searching
 
## Key Use Cases
 
### Data Loading
Create an independent script to load the Zomato restaurant data available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data) into a database.
 
### Web API Service
Develop a web API service with the following endpoints to serve the content loaded in the previous step:
  - **Get Restaurant by ID**: Retrieve details of a specific restaurant by its ID.
  - **Get List of Restaurants**: Fetch a list of restaurants with pagination support.
 
### User Interface
Develop a web application with the following pages, which must connect to the web API service:
  - **Restaurant List Page**: Display a list of restaurants. Clicking on a restaurant should navigate the user to the restaurant's detail page.
  - **Restaurant Detail Page**: Show details of a specific restaurant.
 
## Additional Use Cases (Optional)
If time allows, implement the following additional features, ensuring they are supported in both the API and the UI:
- **Filtering Options**:
  - By Country
  - By Average Spend for Two People
  - By Cuisines
- **Search Functionality**: Enable search for restaurants by name and description.

# Zomato

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
